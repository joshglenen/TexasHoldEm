# TexasHoldEm

The app is in alpha which means it may contain errors which will cause the program to crash. The source files are sprted and included in the source files folder. All final documents are commented so as to be readable and reusable. More features are planned but there is no guarantee this app will be released or supported after its release.

# Install Instructions
Download the alpha zip file from the release page, extract, and run the setup. Compatable with Windows 7 and up. Installer used is OneClick and installs in app data instead of program files. Uninstall like any other program.
